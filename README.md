# DualMind 2.0

DualMind is an AI-powered learning assistant designed to simulate a real classroom learning experience.  
Instead of jumping directly to quizzes, DualMind focuses on **conceptual understanding** through a structured learning loop.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Most online learning platforms move quickly from content delivery to assessment, leaving learners with unresolved doubts and weak conceptual clarity. This results in superficial learning and poor retention.

---

## 💡 Solution
DualMind introduces a **Teach → Doubt → Evaluate** learning loop:
1. The AI **teaches** a topic in simple language.
2. It **clears doubts interactively** until the learner confirms understanding.
3. It then **evaluates understanding** through adaptive questioning.
4. Finally, it provides a **learning summary and improvement suggestions**.

This ensures learning happens before evaluation.

## 🧠 How DualMind Works
1. User selects a topic or provides learning content.
2. AI explains the topic step by step.
3. AI enters a doubt-clearing loop.
4. AI switches role to student and asks questions.
5. User answers and receives feedback.
6. Session ends with a learning summary.
